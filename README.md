# hidden-markov-model
A rock paper scissors game, with hidden markov model used by
bot to have better prediction of future player movements.
As an argument, we give the number of points to which the game is to be played. 
If the bot wins, one point is subtracted from our total, if we win, the point is added. 
For example, if we win alternately, we can play forever.
