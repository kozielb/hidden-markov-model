# hidden-markov-model
A rock paper scissors game, with hidden markov model used by
bot to have better prediction of future player movements.

I didn't use any modules like hmmlearn. 
The main goal of this project was to understand the concept of HMM and to create your own implementation.

As an argument, we give the number of points to which the game is to be played. 
If the bot wins, one point is subtracted from our total, if we win, the point is added. 
For example, if we win alternately, we can play forever.
